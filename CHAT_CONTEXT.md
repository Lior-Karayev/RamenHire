# RamenHire — Chat Context (onboarding doc for new Claude sessions)

> Generated 2026-07-06, last updated 2026-07-15. This is a snapshot, not a live document — verify anything load-bearing (row counts, deployment status, env vars) against the actual code/DB before acting on it. See `CLAUDE.md` in the project root for the authoritative, auto-loaded technical reference; this file adds narrative/decision context that CLAUDE.md doesn't cover.

## 1. Project Overview & Current Status

RamenHire is a job board exclusively for **bootstrapped, profitable startups**. Candidates browse and apply to jobs for free; employers post jobs (currently free during early access, intended to be $99 long-term). The pitch to candidates: "no VC pressure, no layoff roulette."

**Phase: validation / MVP.** No user authentication for job-seekers. Admin access is via the Supabase dashboard only — there is no admin UI in the app.

**Launched:** 2026-07-04. As of this writing the site has been live for ~2.5 days with very low traffic volume (~23 total users) — still far too early to draw firm conclusions from analytics. See section 6.

## 3. Everything Built So Far

In rough chronological order (see `git log` for exact commits):

- Next.js app scaffold, SEO metadata, hydration fixes
- GA4 analytics wired in via `next/script` (`G-1X6XVB58KC`) — as of 2026-07-07, gated behind cookie consent (see below), not unconditional
- Automatic sitemap generation (`next-sitemap`)
- OG image + social preview meta tags, Puppeteer screenshot script, favicon/manifest
- JobPosting JSON-LD schema markup (fixed to resolve Search Console errors)
- GA4 custom event tracking: `apply_click`, `post_job_click`, `subscribe_submitted`, `application_submitted`, `post_job_submitted`, `form_start`, `launch_popup_cta_click`
- Supabase integration replacing what were originally Google Forms — internal apply/post-job/subscribe forms writing directly to Supabase tables
- CV file upload to Supabase Storage (`cvs` bucket) with link fallback
- Two production bugs found & fixed:
  - CV upload 400 error on non-ASCII (Hebrew) filenames — fixed by storing as `{timestamp}.{ext}`, original name kept in `cv_file_name`
  - Live-site 403 "Invalid Compact JWS" — wrong Supabase key type on Vercel (`sb_publishable_*` instead of the JWT anon key)
- Admin email notifications via Resend (`lib/email.ts`, `lib/email-templates.ts`) for all form types → `hello@ramenhire.com` (migrated from `liork03@gmail.com` on 2026-07-07 — see note in §12), from `notifications@ramenhire.com`. Originally routed through a shared `app/api/notify/route.ts`; that route was deleted 2026-07-07 once all four forms got their own dedicated, rate-limited API routes (`/api/apply`, `/api/post-job`, `/api/subscribe`, `/api/companies/register`) that each send their own email directly.
- Launch-week popup (scroll-triggered, once per session, desktop only, shows dynamic job count)
- Local dev setup: full Docker-based local Supabase stack + migration workflow (see section 4)
- Job tags, pagination (6/page), strikethrough pricing UI, 7 additional job listings
- **Migrated job listings from a hardcoded array to a real `job_listings` Supabase table** — `app/page.tsx` is now a server component; interactive UI lives in `app/HomeClient.tsx`
- Internal apply modal restored on job cards (CV upload + link fallback), FK'd to `job_listings.id`
- SEO pass: "remote" added to title/H1/hero subtitle, brand name prepended to meta description, keyword reinforcement
- Homepage stats bar (dynamic job count from `totalCount` + hardcoded countries/bootstrapped/VC-funding stats), between hero and value props
- "Why Bootstrapped?" explainer section (consolidated to a single 6-card section on 2026-07-07 — previously two overlapping sections with a duplicated "Profitable by Default" card)
- Employer CTA section between job listings and email signup, linking to `/post-job?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=employers`
- Hover/tap tooltip on the "Bootstrapped ✓" job-card badge explaining the term (tap auto-hides after 3s on mobile)
- Positioning copy pass based on real user feedback: hero subheadline and employer CTA now reinforce "funding philosophy is part of the hiring criteria"; meta description updated to match
- **Company self-registration + public profiles** (2026-07-07, promoted to production 2026-07-08): `/companies` (directory, approved-only), `/companies/register` (public form), `/companies/[slug]` (profile). `companies` table. `is_verified`/`is_bootstrapped` are admin-only fields, enforced via RLS. Homepage job cards link to a company's profile when a curated `job_listings` row matches by name/website.
- **Email verification for company registration** (2026-07-07, same day, registration-only — apply/post-a-job/subscribe are unchanged): submitting the form no longer inserts a `pending` row directly. It inserts `status='unverified'` with a random token + 48h expiry, and sends a verification email via Resend. Clicking the link (`/companies/register/verify?token=...`) is what actually moves the row to `status='pending'` (into the admin queue) — done server-side via a service-role Supabase client (`lib/supabase-admin.ts`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env.local`) so `anon` never gets an UPDATE policy on `companies` at all. Expired links offer a one-click resend. Admin notification + company "we're reviewing it" confirmation emails now fire at verification-success time, not at initial submit.
- **Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, GDPR cookie consent banner** (2026-07-07): `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-use`, footer links site-wide. GA4 (`gtag`) is no longer loaded unconditionally in `app/layout.tsx` — the `<Script>` tags are now conditionally rendered by `components/CookieConsentBanner.tsx` and genuinely absent from the page until a visitor accepts (verified empirically, not just configured). Declining after a prior accept actively clears the `_ga`/`_ga_1X6XVB58KC` cookies, not just stops refreshing them. Admin notifications migrated from `liork03@gmail.com` to `hello@ramenhire.com` — **mail delivery to that inbox was not confirmed as of 2026-07-07**, only that MX records point to Google Workspace at the domain level.
- **Rate limiting + bot protection on all 4 public write paths** (2026-07-07, promoted to production 2026-07-08): apply, post-job, subscribe, and company registration no longer insert directly from the browser via the anon key — `anon`'s INSERT grant was **revoked** on `applications`, `job_post_requests`, `subscribers`, and `companies` (see migration `20260707000006_rate_limiting_and_hardening.sql` plus the in-place edit to `20260707000005_create_companies.sql`). Every write now goes through a new dedicated Route Handler (`/api/apply`, `/api/post-job`, `/api/subscribe`, `/api/companies/register`) using the `service_role` client, which is what makes the following actually enforceable rather than just cosmetic:
  - **Rate limiting**: IP-based, backed by a new `rate_limit_hits` table (`lib/rate-limit.ts`) — 5/hour for apply/post-job/register, 3/hour for subscribe. Not Redis/Upstash — a Postgres count-then-insert check, appropriate for this site's traffic volume.
  - **Cloudflare Turnstile** on apply + register only (post-job/subscribe skipped as lower priority): `components/TurnstileWidget.tsx` (client) + `lib/turnstile.ts` (server-side `siteverify` call). Real Cloudflare site/secret keys are live in production as of 2026-07-08 (see checklist below) — confirmed via a real widget solve against `www.ramenhire.com`, not just config inspection.
  - The old shared `app/api/notify/route.ts` was **deleted** — each new route sends its own email directly now.
- **Signed upload URLs for `cvs` and `company-logos` Storage** (2026-07-08): closed the residual gap noted above — anon can no longer upload to either bucket directly. The `anon_upload_cvs`/`anon_upload_company_logos` RLS policies on `storage.objects` were dropped (migration `20260708000007_signed_storage_uploads.sql`), applied to **both local and production**. New flow for both `/api/apply` and `/api/companies/register`:
  - Client POSTs metadata first (through the existing rate-limited/Turnstile-gated route) with just the file's *name*, not its bytes.
  - Server generates the row's id itself, mints a signed upload URL (`lib/storage-upload.ts`, `createSignedUploadUrl` via `service_role`) scoped to `{row_id}/{timestamp}.{ext}`, and returns it to the client.
  - Client uploads the actual bytes via `uploadToSignedUrl` — the signed token authorizes the upload without needing any anon RLS grant at all.
  - **CVs**: `cv_storage_path` is set optimistically at insert time. If the upload never completes (closed tab, network drop), the row is simply left referencing a path with no file — accepted as-is, since CVs are private/admin-only and there's already a `cv_link` fallback.
  - **Company logos**: handled more carefully, because logos render **publicly** (`<img>`, no error fallback) on `/companies` and `/companies/[slug]`. `logo_url` is never set at insert time — instead `pending_logo_path` + a single-use `logo_confirm_token` (new nullable `companies` columns) are stored, and a new route `/api/companies/confirm-logo` promotes `pending_logo_path` → `logo_url` only after the client confirms the upload actually succeeded. A failed/abandoned logo upload just leaves `logo_url` null — registration still succeeds, logo stays genuinely optional.
  - Bucket-level `file_size_limit`/`allowed_mime_types` enforcement is unaffected by this change (applies regardless of upload method).
- **Production verification pass (2026-07-08) found and fixed two separate, unrelated production-breaking bugs** that the initial deploy of the above didn't catch — see the Production Verification Findings subsection under §10 for full detail. Short version: (1) a legacy, dashboard-created anon-upload policy on the `cvs` bucket survived the signed-upload-URL migration because it didn't match the name the `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` targeted — anon could still upload directly, unfixed until a follow-up migration (`20260708000008_drop_legacy_anon_cvs_upload_policy.sql`) targeted the real policy name; (2) the production `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` on Vercel was invalid, which silently broke **all four** write API routes (every apply/post-job/subscribe/register submission failed with a generic "Something went wrong") until the user corrected the key and redeployed. Both confirmed fixed via live re-tests against production, not just code inspection.
- **ISR revalidation fix for `/`, `/companies`, `/companies/[slug]` (2026-07-15).** These pages had no `revalidate`/`dynamic` export, so Next.js statically prerendered them once at the last deploy and Vercel served that frozen HTML indefinitely — any DB-only change (e.g. an admin toggling a `job_listings.is_active` row) had **zero effect on the live site** until the next code deploy. Found while trying to deactivate a specific company's listing (Featurebase, at their request) — the DB update was confirmed correct, but the listing kept showing live. Fixed by adding `export const revalidate = 60;` to all three pages, so a DB change now propagates within a minute without needing a redeploy.
- **Pricing CTA copy fix + sitewide metadata regression fix (2026-07-15).** The homepage hero and `/post-job` submit buttons showed both "Free" and a struck-through `$99` stacked on the button itself, read as ambiguous — standardized to a clean "Free" on the button with the `$99`/early-access context moved to small supporting text nearby, matching the pattern already used elsewhere (the `/post-job` page body, the launch-week popup). Separately, `/post-job` and 5 other routes (`/companies`, `/companies/register`, `/companies/[slug]`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-use`) were found to be silently missing `twitter:card`, `twitter:creator`, and `og:image` in their served HTML. Root cause: **Next.js does not deep-merge `openGraph`/`twitter` objects between a layout and a page** — a page-level `openGraph`/`twitter` object completely replaces the root layout's defaults rather than merging into them, so any page defining its own partial object silently drops whatever it doesn't redeclare. Fixed structurally, not just patched: added `lib/metadata.ts` (`buildPageMetadata()`) as the single source of truth for these defaults (type, siteName, locale, card, creator, fallback OG image), and rewired all 6 affected pages — plus the new `/contact` page below — to use it from the start.
- **New `/contact` page (2026-07-15).** Public contact form — name, email, optional reason dropdown, message — so visitors don't have to dig through the Privacy Policy for an email address. `app/contact/page.tsx` + `ContactClient.tsx`, `app/api/contact/route.ts`. Same abuse protections as the other public forms: 5/hour IP rate limit (`checkRateLimit`) and a server-side honeypot check, both verified live in production (6th request → 429; honeypot-filled submission produced no email, confirmed by cross-checking Resend's own send log). Sends an admin notification to `hello@ramenhire.com` via the existing Resend setup (`contactMessageTemplate` in `lib/email-templates.ts`, same `escapeHtml()` pattern as every other template). Unlike the other 4 forms, this one has **no DB table** — it's email-only, nothing to review in Supabase. Linked in the site footer; picked up automatically by `next-sitemap` (no manual sitemap edit needed).
- **Cookieless, consent-independent analytics: GoatCounter + Vercel Web Analytics + Vercel Speed Insights (2026-07-15).** Added after discovering GA4 had recorded **zero** users/sessions/events for 7 straight days (2026-07-09 → 07-15) — not a real traffic drop, but because GA4 only loads after a visitor clicks "Accept" on the cookie banner and almost nobody does. See Section 6 for full detail on what each tool actually collects (sourced from their own current docs, not assumed). All three load unconditionally in `app/layout.tsx`, **outside** `CookieConsentBanner`'s gating — verified live (fresh production visit, no cookie interaction: `gtag` stayed `undefined`, GoatCounter's `/count` request fired and returned `200`, `window.si`/`window.va` both initialized with zero console errors). `lib/analytics.ts`'s `trackEvent()` now dispatches to GoatCounter alongside GA4 from the one existing call site. GA4 itself is untouched and confirmed still working exactly as before once a visitor does accept.
- **Privacy Policy updated for the above (2026-07-15).** Sections 1, 4, and 5 now disclose GoatCounter, Vercel Web Analytics, and Vercel Speed Insights as processors, and Section 5 explains why they aren't gated behind the cookie banner the way GA4 is — they set no cookie at all (verified per each tool's own current docs: GoatCounter discards IP after deriving a country-level location; Vercel Web Analytics uses a request hash discarded after 24h; Speed Insights is anonymous by design), so a pageview record still fires pre-consent without contradicting the "no non-essential cookie until you accept" claim. Caught and fixed a real JSX whitespace-collapsing bug during verification (multi-line text immediately after a `</strong>` tag silently lost its leading space in the actual build output, e.g. "GoatCounter— cookieless" instead of "GoatCounter — cookieless") — fixed with explicit `{" "}` and reverified against a clean production build before pushing, not just the long-running dev server.

## 4. Current Database Schema

**Supabase project:** `oweurollqvbffehorhss` — `https://oweurollqvbffehorhss.supabase.co`
All tables: RLS enabled. Anon can INSERT only; authenticated can SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE.

Live row counts as of 2026-07-08 (production, confirmed): `job_listings`=20 (real bootstrapped companies), `applications`=7, `job_post_requests`=5, `subscribers`=5, `companies`=0 (no real registrations yet — see [[employer-growth-strategy]]).

### `job_listings` (11 rows)
| Column | Type | Nullable | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| id | uuid PK | NO | gen_random_uuid() |
| title | text | NO | — |
| company | text | NO | — |
| company_website | text | YES | — |
| salary | text | YES | — |
| location | text | NO | — |
| job_type | text | NO | — |
| description | text | NO | — |
| tags | text[] | YES | '{}' |
| apply_url | text | NO | — |
| is_bootstrapped | boolean | YES | true |
| is_active | boolean | YES | true |
| is_featured | boolean | YES | false |
| date_posted | date | YES | CURRENT_DATE |
| valid_through | date | YES | CURRENT_DATE + 90 days |
| created_at / updated_at | timestamptz | YES | now() |

### `applications` (7 rows)
id, job_title, company_name, applicant_name, applicant_email, why_interested, cv_link, cv_storage_path, cv_file_name, created_at, status ('pending'), **job_id** (uuid FK → `job_listings.id`, added in migration `20260705000004`).

### `job_post_requests` (5 rows)
id, company_name, contact_name, contact_email, company_website, revenue_range (enum-like text), job_title, job_type, location, salary_range, job_description, company_description, is_bootstrapped, application_link, tags (text[], added later), created_at, status ('pending').

### `subscribers` (5 rows)
id, full_name, email (unique), role_types (text[]), created_at.

### Storage: `cvs` bucket
Private, 5 MB limit, PDF/DOC/DOCX only. Path pattern: `{application_id}/{timestamp}.{ext}` (namespaced by the owning `applications` row's id since the 2026-07-08 signed-upload-URL rework — see section 3). RLS: no anon INSERT (uploads only via signed URLs minted server-side), authenticated SELECT + DELETE.

**Migrations** live in `supabase/migrations/` (all applied to both local and production):
`20260101000000_initial_schema.sql`, `20260101000001_cv_storage.sql`, `20260101000002_add_tags_to_job_post_requests.sql`, `20260705000003_create_job_listings.sql`, `20260705000004_add_job_id_to_applications.sql`, `20260707000005_create_companies.sql`, `20260707000006_rate_limiting_and_hardening.sql`, `20260708000007_signed_storage_uploads.sql`, `20260708000008_drop_legacy_anon_cvs_upload_policy.sql` (production-only fix — see §10 Production Verification Findings; a no-op when run locally since local never had the differently-named legacy policy).

Note: `docs/DATABASE.md` predates the `job_listings` table and migration-based workflow — it's stale; this file and `CLAUDE.md` are more current.

## 5. Platforms Posted On & Status

Confirmed by the user on 2026-07-06 (supersedes earlier GA4-inferred guesses):

- ✅ **LinkedIn** — "building in public" update post live
- ✅ **Twitter/X** — 3 tweets posted (intro, insight, jobs thread)
- ✅ **Indie Hackers** — Show IH post live, getting comments
- ✅ **Dev.to** — 2 articles published (launch story + Supabase RLS tutorial)
- ✅ **Product Hunt** — listing created, launch scheduled (not yet live)
- ❌ **Reddit** — posts auto-removed; account (`u/L_Build`) is only 6 days old and hitting new-account/low-karma auto-removal restrictions
- ❌ **Hacker News** — account too new to post

**Why GA4 didn't show most of this (see section 6):** UTM tags are still not implemented on any shared link, so clicks from these platforms are likely landing as "Direct" or being misattributed rather than showing up as their real source. Don't use GA4's channel breakdown to judge which platforms are working until UTM tagging is added — the posting activity above is more reliable than the analytics for now.

**Reddit specifically:** the karma/age restriction is a platform-side blocker, not a content problem — it should resolve on its own as the account ages and accumulates karma elsewhere on Reddit, not by re-tweaking post content.

---

## 6. Analytics Setup

- **GoatCounter + Vercel Web Analytics + Vercel Speed Insights (added 2026-07-15) — permanent, consent-independent baselines, run alongside GA4.** GA4 is structurally undercounted by design: it only loads after a visitor clicks "Accept" on the cookie consent banner (see below), and a live investigation on 2026-07-15 found GA4 had recorded **zero** users/sessions/events for 7 straight days (2026-07-09 through 07-15) — not because traffic stopped, but because essentially no visitor was clicking Accept. All three tools set no cookies and load unconditionally in `app/layout.tsx`, **outside** `CookieConsentBanner`'s gating entirely — they need no consent because they collect nothing that requires it (see `/privacy-policy` Sections 4–5 for exactly what each tool collects, sourced from their own current docs, not assumed). `lib/analytics.ts`'s `trackEvent()` helper now fires the same custom event (`apply_click`, `post_job_click`, `subscribe_submitted`, etc.) into both GA4 (if consented) and GoatCounter (always) from one call site. Having independent, non-overlapping measurement methods also means one can sanity-check another going forward — useful given GA4's silent blind spot went unnoticed for a week. GA4 stays as-is for the richer event/funnel data from visitors who do consent; these are the always-on floor underneath it.
  - **GoatCounter**: `https://ramenhire.goatcounter.com`. Its own script has a built-in `localhost` skip (won't fire real hits from local dev — confirmed by design, not a bug; verified end-to-end against the real production domain instead during setup).
  - **Vercel Web Analytics**: visible in the Vercel dashboard's Analytics tab (Hobby plan, free up to 50k events/month). No-ops with a console debug message in local dev builds — only sends real data from the deployed production domain.
  - **Vercel Speed Insights**: same dashboard, separate "Speed Insights" tab (also enabled free on Hobby). Package `@vercel/speed-insights`, `<SpeedInsights />` in `app/layout.tsx`. Same local-dev no-op behavior as Web Analytics.
- **GA4** property: `G-1X6XVB58KC`, wired in via `next/script` in `app/layout.tsx`. GA4 property ID for the Analytics API/MCP is `543943905` (account "Default Account for Firebase").
- Custom events firing correctly: `apply_click`, `post_job_click`, `subscribe_submitted`, `application_submitted`, `post_job_submitted`, `form_start`, `launch_popup_cta_click`.
- **Google Search Console:** confirmed by the user to be connected and verified (2026-07-06). No Search Console MCP/tool is currently wired into this Claude Code setup, so query-level data still needs to be pulled from the Search Console UI/API directly rather than via `analytics-mcp`. Confirmed ranking: **"bootstrapped startups hiring" — position 13**.
- **UTM links:** **still not set up anywhere** — confirmed by grepping the codebase (no `utm_` string exists) and by GA4 showing `sessionCampaignName` = `(direct)` or `(referral)` on every single session since launch, never a real campaign value. User has confirmed this is a known gap, to be added going forward on all shared links.
- **Data quality caveat:** traffic volume is tiny (~23 users total as of 2026-07-06) and a meaningful chunk looks like the founder's own testing rather than organic visitors (e.g., Israel-based sessions have high sessions-per-user; 2 users alone generated 18 `apply_click` events). 13 US sessions show ~1.8s avg duration and 0% engagement — consistent with bot/crawler traffic, not real visitors. Don't trust channel/country/engagement breakdowns until volume grows substantially.
- `analytics-mcp` (Google Analytics MCP server) is registered and working — use `run_report` with `property_id: 543943905` directly rather than re-discovering it via `get_account_summaries`.

## 7. Social Media Accounts & Handles

Confirmed by the user on 2026-07-06 — all active:

| Platform | Handle | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Twitter/X | `@L_Build` | Personal brand account — **not** `@ramenhire`. The `@ramenhire` handle in `app/layout.tsx`'s `twitter.creator` meta tag is stale/aspirational and doesn't match the account actually being used to post. |
| LinkedIn | Personal account, real name | — |
| Indie Hackers | `@L_Build` | — |
| Dev.to | `@L_Build` | — |
| Product Hunt | `@L_Build` | Launch scheduled, not yet live |
| Reddit | `u/L_Build` | Account 6 days old; posts currently auto-removed due to low-karma/new-account restrictions |

**Follow-up worth doing:** `app/layout.tsx`'s Twitter Card `creator` field still says `@ramenhire` — consider updating it to `@L_Build` (or a real `@ramenhire` account if one gets created later) so link previews credit the account actually being used for promotion.

---

## 8. Key Decisions Made

- **Pricing:** employer job posts are priced at **$99** long-term, but currently **free during early access** ("Free during early access 🍜" with strikethrough `~~$99~~") — a deliberate validation-phase decision to lower friction while testing demand. No Stripe/payment integration exists yet; the form only collects posting intent.
- **Validation approach:** ship an MVP with no user auth, admin operations done manually via the Supabase dashboard, and forms writing directly to Supabase rather than building a full back office. Keep scope minimal and appropriate for an unproven, pre-revenue product.
- **Dev/prod separation:** all development work targets a local Supabase stack (`http://localhost:54321`, Docker-based) — never production — until a stable milestone is reached, at which point schema changes are promoted via Supabase MCP with explicit user approval. See `supabase/migrations/` for the migration-first workflow.
- **Deploy workflow:** build (`npm run build`) → `npm audit` → apply any DB migration to prod via Supabase MCP → git push to `main` → Vercel auto-deploys → manually verify on ramenhire.com. Never push to GitHub or run production migrations without explicit user approval — this is a hard rule, not a suggestion.
- **No `any` types**, all async functions need try/catch, `service_role` key must never appear client-side — only `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

---

## 9. Deployed vs. Still Local

**Deployed to production (ramenhire.com via Vercel, auto-deploy on push to `main`):**
- All 12 DB migrations, including `job_listings`, `companies`, `rate_limit_hits`, the signed-upload-URL storage policy changes, the 2026-07-08 legacy-policy fix, and the 2026-07-10 authenticated-DELETE-grant removals on both `cvs` and `company-logos` (see `security-audits/2026-07-10-audit.md`)
- All features listed in section 3, including company self-registration + email verification, rate limiting + Turnstile on all 4 write paths, legal pages/cookie consent, and signed upload URLs for both Storage buckets — **all confirmed working via a real end-to-end pass against production on 2026-07-08** (see §10 Production Verification Findings), not just deployed-and-assumed-working
- Latest known production commit: `285b2c4` ("feat: add Vercel Speed Insights, update privacy policy for GoatCounter/Vercel analytics"). Verified live on ramenhire.com 2026-07-15 — see the 2026-07-15 push addendum below.

**2026-07-15 pushes — verified live (5 commits across 3 separate deploys, all confirmed against production, not just a green build):**
- `984e009` — ISR revalidation fix (`/`, `/companies`, `/companies/[slug]`).
- `232b61f` — pricing CTA copy standardization + `lib/metadata.ts` (`buildPageMetadata()`) sitewide metadata regression fix across 6 pages.
- `8152263` — new `/contact` page + `/api/contact` route.
- `0256e4d` — GoatCounter + Vercel Web Analytics integration.
- `285b2c4` — Vercel Speed Insights + Privacy Policy update disclosing all three new analytics tools.

See Section 3 above for full technical detail on each. All five verified live post-deploy: pricing CTA text and `/post-job` metadata head tags checked directly against production HTML; a real test message was submitted through the live `/contact` form (Resend confirmed `"last_event":"delivered"` to `hello@ramenhire.com`), its honeypot and rate limit (5/hour) both tripped correctly against the real endpoint, and the 5 `rate_limit_hits` test rows this created in production were deleted afterward — **the 4 test emails themselves could not be deleted** (no inbox access) and are still sitting in `hello@ramenhire.com`, subject-prefixed and marked "DELETE ME", waiting on manual cleanup; GoatCounter/GA4/Speed Insights were all checked on a fresh, no-cookie-interaction production page load (GoatCounter's `/count` fired and returned `200`, `gtag` correctly stayed `undefined`, `window.si`/`window.va` both initialized with zero console errors), and GA4 was separately re-confirmed still working normally for a session that does click Accept.
- **One `job_listings` row deactivated in production (2026-07-15, unrelated to the code pushes above):** Featurebase's "Full-Stack Product Engineer" listing (`id 9e6c397b-a006-442f-9a06-d15983cf09f1`) was set `is_active = false` at the company's own request (they manage hiring via their own Notion board). This is a **data** change, not a schema/migration change — no new migration file. Confirmed gone from the homepage, company-matching logic, and JSON-LD after the ISR fix above (it was initially still showing live post-deactivation because of the static-caching bug that fix addresses — see Section 3).

**2026-07-10 security-audit follow-up push — verified live:** removed the broad `authenticated` DELETE grant from both the `cvs` and `company-logos` Storage buckets, added rate limiting to `/api/companies/resend-verification`, added `escapeHtml()` to all outbound email templates, and added a server-side honeypot check to company registration. **Repeat of the exact 2026-07-08 legacy-policy-name bug**: applying the `cvs` migration to production revealed a second dashboard-created legacy policy, `"Allow authenticated deletes"` (different name than the migration-tracked `auth_delete_cvs`), which the `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "auth_delete_cvs"` migration silently no-op'd against — closed with a follow-up migration (`20260710154545_drop_legacy_authenticated_delete_cvs_policy.sql`) targeting the real name, confirmed via direct `pg_policies` inspection. **Lesson reinforced:** always inspect `pg_policies` directly on production after a `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` migration for storage.objects — don't trust "migration applied successfully" as proof the intended policy is actually gone, since dashboard-created objects from before the migration system routinely don't match local naming. All four fixes re-verified against production itself (not just local) after the push: a genuine (non-crafted) Supabase Auth test session confirmed 403 on DELETE for real synthetic test objects in both buckets; the resend-verification rate limit was tripped live (6th request → 429); a real application was submitted through the live UI with an HTML-injection payload in `applicant_name` to exercise the real `escapeHtml()` code path in production (payload confirmed stored correctly; the actual rendered email in `hello@ramenhire.com` was **not** independently viewed — no inbox access — so that specific rendering claim rests on the local unit test of the same function, not a live inbox check); and the honeypot check was confirmed live both ways (filled → no row, empty → real row created). All test data cleaned up and confirmed removed afterward.

**Env vars on Vercel — all confirmed set (2026-07-08):**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` ✅
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ✅
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` ✅ — **was invalid/stale as of the 2026-07-08 morning deploy** (caused a full write-path outage, see §10), corrected by the user and confirmed working via live logs the same day
- `RESEND_API_KEY` ✅ — admin email notifications confirmed working in production, including the company-registration verification email (real send-and-click confirmed 2026-07-08)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` / `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` ✅ — real Cloudflare keys live, confirmed via a real widget solve against production

**Still local-only / not yet done:**
- No UTM tagging on any outbound marketing links
- No payment integration (Stripe not installed)
- No admin UI (dashboard access only)
- No receiving/reply-to email inbox set up — Resend is currently one-way (outbound admin notifications only)
- Literal browser file-upload (CV/logo bytes via a real file picker) was not exercised end-to-end in the 2026-07-08 verification pass — the browser automation tool available that session couldn't attach local files, so the apply/register flows were verified using their link-fallback paths instead. The signed-upload-URL *mechanism* itself was directly verified (policy-level anon-upload rejection tested before/after the fix), just not a literal file picker → signed PUT → row round-trip through the real UI.

## 10. Next Tasks in the Pipeline

Known open items, not a committed roadmap — confirm priority with the user:

1. **Add UTM parameters to every future external link** shared on any platform (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Indie Hackers, Dev.to, Product Hunt), so channel attribution in GA4 becomes trustworthy — still the single biggest analytics gap.
2. **Product Hunt launch** — listing exists but hasn't gone live yet; plan/schedule the actual launch day.
3. **Reddit** — no action needed beyond waiting; account is too new/low-karma for posts to survive. Revisit once the account ages and builds karma elsewhere.
4. Let traffic accumulate before drawing conclusions from analytics — current volume (~23 users) is too small to be meaningful; revisit once volume is materially higher.
5. ~~Consider updating the stale `@ramenhire` Twitter Card handle in `app/layout.tsx` to `@L_Build`~~ — **done as a side effect of the 2026-07-15 metadata regression fix.** `lib/metadata.ts`'s `buildPageMetadata()` sets `twitter.creator: "@L_Build"` sitewide now; confirmed live in production HTML.
6. Receiving/reply-to inbox question is now superseded by the `hello@ramenhire.com` mail-delivery check in the production-push checklist below — **and independently reconfirmed 2026-07-15** via the `/contact` form test (Resend's own API showed `"last_event":"delivered"` for a real message to that inbox).
7. **Delete 4 test emails from `hello@ramenhire.com` (2026-07-15, manual, no inbox access to do it remotely):** subjects "Claude Code Verification Test - DELETE ME" and "RL Prod Test 1/2/3 - DELETE ME", generated verifying the new `/contact` form against production. Harmless, just inbox clutter.
8. ~~Deliberately deferred (2026-07-10): real admin-role infrastructure for RLS.~~ **Resolved 2026-07-21** as part of the Company Auth sprint (`sprints/2026-07-21-company-auth-sprint.md`, Phase G) — the exact trigger named below ("any feature introduces real end-user accounts") is what that sprint built. `companies.is_admin` is the real admin flag; `public.is_admin()`/`public.my_company_id()` SECURITY DEFINER helpers back real per-owner/admin-scoped RLS policies across all five tables named below, replacing every blanket `authenticated ... USING (true)` policy. Verified directly against PostgREST with real JWTs (cross-company access rejected, owner/admin access still works) and a final live `pg_policies` sweep confirming zero blanket policies remain anywhere in the schema. Full detail in `security-audits/2026-07-10-audit.md`'s own "Resolved — 2026-07-21" section. **Not yet in production** — local only, pending the rest of the sprint's review. Original note, for context: `applications`, `job_post_requests`, `subscribers`, `companies`, and `job_listings` all granted the Postgres `authenticated` role broad SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE (and INSERT for `job_listings`) via `USING (true)` policies — i.e. RLS treated "authenticated" as a proxy for "admin," contained only because no real end-user auth existed yet.

### Production-Push Checklist (target: 2026-07-08)

**Push happened 2026-07-08** (`c198ce7`) and was verified end-to-end the same day. Concrete and time-bound — distinct from the open items above. See [[rate-limiting-and-bot-protection]], [[legal-pages-and-consent]], [[companies-email-verification]] for the full technical context behind each item.

- [x] **`hello@ramenhire.com` mail delivery** — **confirmed 2026-07-15** via the `/contact` form live test: Resend's own API showed `"last_event":"delivered"` for a real message sent to that inbox. Carried over as unconfirmed since 2026-07-07; now resolved.
- [x] **Cloudflare Turnstile real keys** — done and confirmed live 2026-07-08 via a real widget solve against production (not just config inspection).
- [x] **Storage bucket anon-upload restriction — done properly, both environments.** Confirmed via live production re-test 2026-07-08 (see Production Verification Findings below) — the first attempt at this actually left a gap in prod that a follow-up migration had to close.
- [ ] Resend usage check (currently 38/3000, healthy) — manual vendor-dashboard reminder, not urgent, revisit at push time.
- [ ] Supabase plan/Spend Cap confirmation (no card on file, Spend Cap default protections apply) — manual vendor-dashboard reminder, not urgent, revisit at push time.
- [x] Outreach email placeholders updated with the real production registration URL — done as of 2026-07-07, `outreach/outreach-emails.txt` uses `https://www.ramenhire.com/companies/register` directly (see section 13).

### Production Verification Findings (2026-07-08)

A post-deploy verification pass against production (not just "it deployed successfully") turned up two unrelated, real production-breaking bugs that a deploy-status check alone would have missed. Documented here because both are the kind of thing a future session might otherwise re-discover the hard way:

1. **Legacy anon-upload Storage policy survived the "fix."** The `cvs` bucket had a policy named `"Allow anonymous uploads"`, created directly via the Supabase dashboard before the migration system existed for this project — a different name than the `anon_upload_cvs` policy the local/migration-tracked schema used. The 2026-07-08 signed-upload-URL migration (`20260708000007`) ran `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "anon_upload_cvs" ON storage.objects`, which silently no-op'd against the real production policy. Net effect: anon could still `POST` directly to the Storage REST API and upload a file to `cvs`, completely bypassing the new signed-URL/rate-limit/Turnstile gating — confirmed live with a raw unauthenticated `curl POST`, which returned `200` before the fix. A second migration (`20260708000008_drop_legacy_anon_cvs_upload_policy.sql`) targeting the actual policy name fixed it; re-tested live afterward and confirmed `403`. **Lesson for future schema changes to this project:** don't assume a `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` closes a gap just because the migration ran without error — verify the policy actually existed under that exact name in production, since dashboard-created objects from before the migration system don't necessarily match local naming.
2. **Production `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` was invalid, breaking all 4 write APIs.** Independent of bug #1. Every one of `/api/apply`, `/api/post-job`, `/api/subscribe`, `/api/companies/register` calls `supabaseAdmin` (service_role client) for both the rate-limit check and the actual insert — and every one of those Supabase calls was failing with `401 Unauthorized`, confirmed directly in Supabase's own API logs (`POST | 401 | .../rest/v1/applications | node`, etc.). The client-side symptom was a generic "Something went wrong" on every submission — not obviously a config problem from the outside. This means **no real applicant, employer, subscriber, or company registration could get through in production from the time of the `c198ce7` deploy until this was caught and fixed** the same day. Root cause was never fully diagnosed (likely a stale/mistyped/wrong-format key value in Vercel — possibly the newer `sb_secret_*` format vs. the legacy JWT format `createClient()` expects here, echoing the earlier `sb_publishable_*`-vs-anon-JWT mixup from 2026-07-06). Fixed by the user updating the key in Vercel and redeploying; a first redeploy attempt did *not* immediately show the fix (log evidence still showed 401 for a couple of minutes after push), so don't assume a redeploy instantly propagates a changed env var without re-checking logs. **Lesson:** a "deploy succeeded" status only means the build compiled — it says nothing about whether the deployed environment's secrets are actually valid. Any future production push involving `service_role`-backed routes should include a live write-path smoke test (not just a homepage load check) before declaring it done.

Both fixes were verified with real, obviously-labeled test data (`"TEST DELETE ME"`) submitted through the actual production UI (apply+CV via link fallback, company register+verify-email flow through to `status='pending'`), then deleted afterward — production tables and the `cvs` Storage bucket were confirmed clean of test artifacts as of 2026-07-08.

## 12. Email Setup (Detail)

- Resend domain **`ramenhire.com` is verified** (DKIM verified) — deliverability from this domain is properly configured, not just "set up and hoping."
- Sending address: `notifications@ramenhire.com`
- Admin notifications confirmed working in production for all 3 form types: `applications`, `job_post_requests`, `subscribers`. **As of 2026-07-07 this moved off the shared `app/api/notify/route.ts` (deleted)** — see rate-limiting/bot-protection note below for the current per-form API routes.
- **Admin notifications migrated to `hello@ramenhire.com` on 2026-07-07** (was `liork03@gmail.com`). **Mail delivery to `hello@` is not yet confirmed** — DNS shows an MX record pointing to `smtp.google.com` (consistent with Google Workspace being configured for the domain), but that only confirms mail routing exists for the domain, not that the specific `hello@` mailbox/alias has been provisioned inside Workspace. Confirm this receives mail before relying on it in production or promising it as a working contact channel anywhere (e.g. the Privacy Policy).

## 13. Outreach / Contacts Log

- **Aryan Singh Yadav** (`hello@beryxa.com`) reached out unsolicited — appears to be a domain seller/consultant. User replied politely; no further action taken or needed. Logged here only so a future session doesn't mistake this for a real partnership lead or re-engage unnecessarily.
- **Company model terminology (2026-07-07, confirmed permanent): self-registration only, never pre-populated/claim-based.** Any earlier "claim flow" / "claim_token" architecture was a rejected draft that never actually existed in the repo (see [[companies-feature]]) — do not resurrect it. Outreach copy does still casually use the word "claim" (e.g. "claim it with a free company profile") as ordinary marketing language for *creating* a registration — that's unrelated to the old pre-populate-and-claim database model and is not a sign the old model came back.
- **Outreach emails rewritten (2026-07-07)** — `outreach/outreach-emails.txt` now uses a permission-ask-first structure: state the role is featured on the site, offer to remove it, then offer free self-registration via `https://www.ramenhire.com/companies/register`. This replaces the original draft's "we already listed you" framing, which was flagged as potentially misleading (implied an existing relationship these 13 companies don't actually have). **Ready to send as of 2026-07-07.** Known limitation: the job link in each email points to `https://www.ramenhire.com/#jobs` (homepage anchor), not a specific role — there's no individual job permalink page in the app yet, so this was the best real, working link available rather than an invented one.
- **Top-of-funnel priority (as of 2026-07-07): attracting real registered companies comes before any job-seeker growth push** — the product has no real employer data yet (see [[employer-growth-strategy]] — zero real registrations as of this writing, all `companies` table testing to date used fake test data). **Next planned activity (2026-07-08):** manual outreach to the 13 companies via the rewritten emails above, plus a new parallel effort reaching out to HR contacts/hiring managers directly on LinkedIn to raise employer-side awareness of RamenHire (not candidate-side/job-seeker outreach).

## 11. Important Context About Project Direction

- This is a **pre-revenue validation project** for a solo/small team — the guiding principle across all past decisions has been to keep scope minimal, avoid premature infrastructure (no auth, no payments, no admin UI), and prioritize learning whether there's real demand over building out features.
- The user is deliberate about production safety: never push to GitHub or touch production Supabase without explicit approval, always test locally first. This is a hard, repeatedly-reinforced rule, not a one-off preference.
- Early data (as of 2026-07-06) suggests the product mechanics work end-to-end (forms, uploads, emails, DB writes all functioning) but **real distribution hasn't started yet** — the current priority is less "fix the product" and more "get real traffic through known, trackable channels."
- **2026-07-08 caution for future sessions:** a "deploy succeeded" / "migration applied without error" status is not sufficient evidence that production actually works — see the Production Verification Findings under §10. Two separate real production outages (a Storage RLS gap and a fully-broken service_role key) both shipped silently in the same push and were only caught by an explicit live smoke test against `www.ramenhire.com`, not by checking deploy/build status. Treat any future production push the same way: verify with a real write-path request against prod, not just a green deploy.
